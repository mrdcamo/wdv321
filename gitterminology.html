    <h1>Understanding Git Terms</h1>
    
    <h2>Version Control Software</h2>
    <p>Version control software helps developers keep track of changes in their code over time. It allows multiple people to work on the same project without messing up each other’s changes. If something goes wrong, you can always go back to a previous version. Git is one of the most popular tools for this.</p>
    
    <h2>Add</h2>
    <p>When you make changes to files in Git, they don’t get saved automatically. The <code>git add</code> command stages those changes so they’re ready to be committed. Think of it as putting files in a box before sealing it up with a commit.</p>
    
    <h2>Commit</h2>
    <p>A commit is like taking a snapshot of your project at a certain point in time. It saves all the staged changes with a message explaining what was updated. This helps keep track of progress and makes it easy to roll back if needed. You commit changes using <code>git commit -m "your message"</code>.</p>
    
    <h2>Push</h2>
    <p>Pushing sends your commits from your local computer to a remote repository, like GitHub or GitLab, so others can see and work with your updates. The command <code>git push origin main</code> (or another branch name) does the trick.</p>
    
    <h2>Pull</h2>
    <p>Pulling updates your local files with the latest changes from a remote repository. This is important when working in a team, so you always have the most up-to-date version of the project. You can do this with <code>git pull</code>.</p>
    
    <h2>Clone</h2>
    <p>Cloning is like downloading a full copy of a project from a remote repository to your computer. This is how you start working on an existing project stored somewhere like GitHub. You use <code>git clone &lt;repository URL&gt;</code> to get a copy.</p>
